==============================================================================
These are some utility routines I developed to make it easier to write UNIX
daemons.

The stuff in the util/ directory can be linked into anything, including
libraries. Stuff in the core/ directory makes use of globals, so it should only
be linked into daemons, but not into libraries. The jorm/ directory contains
some macros that can be used to automatically serialize and deserialize JSON
data to C structures.

core/fast_log: a fast log intended to be used to "always-on" debugging. Log
messages go to a circular buffer. Normally, you would create one fast_log
buffer per thread. Log messages can be dumped to a file in the signal handler.

core/glitch_log: a slow log which is intended to be used to log serious warning
messages and errors.

core/pid_file: routines for managing a pid file.

core/signal: routines for managing signals. This integrates with fast_log and
glitch_log.

util/compiler.h: macros for making use of compiler-specific features

util/run_cmd: utilities for running external commands.

util/safe_io: utility functions for writing to a raw file descriptor while
properly handling EINTR.

util/str_to_int: a stricter version of atoi and atoll.

util/string: some handy string manipulation routines.

util/tempfile: some routines for manipulating temporary directories.

json: as mentioned before, this directory contains code used to serialize and
deserialize JSON data to C structures. These structures are defined in .jorm
files, and the C code to handle them is generated by #include directives. See
jorm_unit for an example of how to use this.

I am releasing this code under the Apache 2.0 license, in hopes that it will be
useful to you.  See LICENSE.txt for details.

Have fun.
