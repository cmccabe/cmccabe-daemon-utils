/** fast_log is a fast circular buffer used to log routine informational
 * messages during normal daemon operation. The intention is that each thread
 * will have its own fast_log_buf, which it can log its events to.
 *
 * When a crash occurs, we can dump the fast_logs to a file in order to get some
 * insight into what each thread was doing at the moment of the crash.
 * This gives us most of the advantages of using extensive logging, without the
 * huge performance problems of actually writing all those logs to a file
 * constantly. fast_log is active in production mode and is never turned off.
 *
 * The monitor can also request a fast_log dump.
 *
 * fast_log messages are stored in a compact serialized form. Each message must
 * be exactly 32 bytes. The first 2 bytes are a type code. You must register a
 * dumper function to decode the message into a human-readable form during
 * dumping.
